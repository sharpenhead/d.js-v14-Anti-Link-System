This repository includes an anti-link mechanism for your Discord bot, with the ability to set and disable it for your Discord server, and a log channel.

### `❓` **Purpose:**
This is an anti-link system with buttons that allow you to enable and disable it for your server, as well as the ability to record any violations in a specified channel.

### `⚠️` **Warning:**
When copying over the files from this repository, remember to adjust the file paths to match the files on your bot. Also remember to modify the embed colors to your preference.

### `📝` **Side note:**
Please contact me via Discord, RexoPlays's brother#3085, if you have any questions, problems with the system, or if a step is unclear, and I will try my best to assist you!

Also, if you are a Discord Coding Lounge server member and read my initial post, you probably recall that I indicated that in the command, there will be the ability to delete Discord server links, https:// links, or both. I was unable to include this portion because the post received a lot of attention and the reaction goal was quickly achieved. I apologize, and if I do create this function in the future, I will notify you all!
